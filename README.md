## Overview

This voice agent example demonstrates:

- 📞 Handling inbound phone calls
- 📱 Making outbound phone calls
- 🤖 Real-time conversation with Grok Voice Agent API
- 🔄 Automated deployment using Voximplant CI/CD

It is designed to work **out-of-the-box** with minimal setup.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A valid email address for Voximplant account registration
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Grok API credentials (from [x.ai](https://x.ai))
- Git and Node.js installed

---

## Getting Started

### Create a Voximplant Account

1. Go to [Voximplant Sign Up](https://manage.voximplant.com/auth/sign_up)
2. Complete registration: Email, Password, Account Name
3. Verify your email and finish the setup wizard

### Purchase a Phone Number

1. Log in to Voximplant control panel
2. Navigate: **Numbers → Buy Number**
3. Select a country and choose a number
4. Complete the purchase
5. Attach the number to your Application (to be created in the next steps)

### Set Up Your Environment

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd grok-voice-agent-example
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Add Voximplant CI Credentials

Copy the example file, then update it with your Voximplant CI credentials and application settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env`:

```env
# Voximplant CI Credentials
VOX_CI_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/voximplant-credentials.json   # Path to Voximplant service account JSON
VOX_CI_ROOT_PATH=./voxengine_ci_source_files              # Local directory for CI source files
VOX_ACCOUNT_NAME=your_account_name                        # e.g. "mycompany"
VOX_NEW_APP_NAME=your_new_app_name                        # e.g. "grok-voice-agent"
VOX_PHONE_NUMBER=your_rented_phone_number                 # Rented phone number on Voximplant Platform
SCRIPT_CUSTOM_DATA={"clientNum":"+12345678901"}           # Set the phone number you want to make ou
```

Notes

- `VOX_CI_CREDENTIALS` — path to the JSON file you downloaded from Voximplant containing your API key and account information.
- `VOX_CI_ROOT_PATH` — local folder where the CI source files will be prepared before deployment.
- `VOX_ACCOUNT_NAME` — your Voximplant account name.
- `VOX_NEW_APP_NAME` — the name you want to give to the new Voximplant Application.
- `VOX_PHONE_NUMBER` — your rented Voximplant number used as the outbound caller ID
- `SCRIPT_CUSTOM_DATA` — JSON string containing data to pass to the scenario (e.g., client phone number).

> 💡 Tip: VOX_CI_CREDENTIALS should point to the JSON file you downloaded from Voximplant with your API key and account information (read more [how to get it](https://voximplant.com/docs/guides/management-api/authorization#service-accounts))

> 💡 Tip: Make sure the `.env` file is **not committed to version control**, as it contains sensitive credentials. .env is part of the project .gitignore by default.

### Configure Application Name and Account

Update the `application.config.json` file in the `application/` folder:

```json
{
  "applicationName": "YOUR_NEW_APP_NAME.YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME.voximplant.com"
}
```
- **`YOUR_NEW_APP_NAME`** — the name you want to give to the new Voximplant Application
- **`YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME`** — your Voximplant account name (as used in your credentials)

> 💡 **Tip:** This name must match the account name in your `.env` file (`VOX_ACCOUNT_NAME`) and your desired application name (`VOX_NEW_APP_NAME`). Otherwise, the deployment script will fail.

### Configure Voice Agent

The integration with Grok requires an **API key** and **system instructions** for the LLM. These settings are defined in two modules:

- `modules/credentials.voxengine.js` — API key (gitignored)
- `modules/agent_config.voxengine.js` — system instructions and caller ID

#### Example configuration (credentials):

```javascript
const X_API_KEY = 'YOUR_X_API_KEY';
```

#### Example configuration (agent config):

```javascript
const voxNum = 'YOUR_RENTED_PHONE_NUMBER';
const SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS = `
Your system instructions go here...
`;
```

Notes

- `X_API_KEY` — your API key from Grok (xAI).
- `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS` — the system prompt or instructions you want the LLM to follow during the call.
- `voxNum` — your rented Voximplant number used as the outbound caller ID.
- These values are used in both **inbound** and **outbound** scenarios.

> 💡 Tip: Keep your API key private. Do not commit real keys to a public repository. `modules/credentials.voxengine.js` is listed in `.gitignore`.

### Set Voximplant Phone Number

The project uses a rented Voximplant number for both **incoming** and **outgoing** calls. Set the caller ID in `modules/agent_config.voxengine.js`:

```javascript
const voxNum = 'YOUR_RENTED_PHONE_NUMBER';
```

> 💡 Tip: Make sure the same number is properly linked in Voximplant for both inbound and outbound rules to avoid call errors.

### Run the Local CI Deployment

Once your environment and credentials are set up, run the local CI deployment script:

```bash
node project_script.js
```

This script will:

- **Verify your environment variables** (`.env` file) to ensure all required credentials and paths are set.
- **Initialize the Voximplant CI project**, creating the necessary structure for deployment.
- **Copy all scenarios, modules, and configuration files** into the CI project folder.
- **Upload the Application, Rules, and Scenarios** to your Voximplant account.
- **Bind rented phone number** to the uploaded Application

After running the script:
- Ensure the number is associated with two created rules.
   
Now your application will be **fully deployed and ready for testing**.

> 💡 Tip: If you encounter errors, check that your `.env` variables are correct and that your Voximplant account has **sufficient permissions and balance**.

## Testing

This section describes how to test **incoming** and **outgoing** calls after successfully deploying the application in Voximplant using `project_script.js`.

Before testing, make sure that:

- The application is successfully uploaded to Voximplant.
- A phone number is rented and linked to the application.
- The scenarios and rules are active.

---

### Testing Incoming Calls (Inbound)

**Steps:**

1. In the Voximplant control panel, verify that:
    - The rented phone number is linked to your Application.
    - The rule `inboundCalls` is active.

2. Make a regular phone call to the rented Voximplant number.

3. **Expected behavior:**
    - The call will be handled by the `inbound_handler` scenario.
    - A Grok Voice Agent will be created.
    - Audio will be transmitted in real time between the caller and Grok.
    - The dialogue continues until the call ends or the LLM function `hangup_call` is triggered.

4. **Check logs and results:**
    - View **Call History** in the Voximplant panel.
    - Check scenario logs via `Logger.write` messages.

---

### Testing Outgoing Calls (Outbound)

**Steps:**

1. **Verify setup in Voximplant control panel:**
    - Ensure your **rented phone number** is linked to your application.
    - Make sure the **`outboundCalls` rule** is active.

2. **Run the outbound script:**
```bash
node outbound_call_script.js
```

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - The script **automatically fetches the `ruleId`** for the outbound rule.
   - `scriptCustomData` (e.g., client phone number) is passed to the scenario.
   - The call is placed from your **rented Voximplant number** to the client’s number.
   - A **Grok Voice Agent** is created and attached to the call.
   - Audio is transmitted in **real time** between the caller and Grok.
   - The dialogue continues until the call ends or the LLM triggers `hangup_call`.

4. **Verify logs and results:**
   - Check **Call History** in the Voximplant control panel.
   - Review scenario logs via `Logger.write` for step-by-step execution.
---

### Verification

For both inbound and outbound calls:

- Check **Call History** in Voximplant.
- Review scenario logs (`Logger.write`).
- Ensure the Grok WebSocket connection is properly closed after the call ends.

> 💡 Tip: Always test with both inbound and outbound calls to verify **end-to-end voice interaction** with the Grok Voice Agent.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Calls not connecting**
- Verify your phone number is properly configured.
- Check that your application is attached to the phone number.
- Ensure your account has sufficient balance.

**Issue: Grok API errors**
- Verify your API key is correct.
- Check API rate limits.
- Review API endpoint URLs.
